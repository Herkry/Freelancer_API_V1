# **Freelancer API Version 1**
This an API for a freelancing platform that connects freelancers to potential clients, with an android app as the client connected to a Laravel backend using the API.

Clients search for freelancers using filters and send requests through the API. The freelancers evaluate the request and can accept or reject requests. Their response is then relayed to the client who is able to track the progress of their project as the freelancer updates it on their side.
This application was built using MySQL, PHP and Laravel. Postman was also used to test the API requests and view the responses in various formats.
